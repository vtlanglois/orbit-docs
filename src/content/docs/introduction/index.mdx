**Orbit** is a general-purpose CSS framework designed to create radial UI designs effortlessly. It provides intuitive CSS classes and standard web components for building radial menus, dashboards, creative portfolios, or a cutting-edge applications.

Orbit harnesses the power of space-inspired metaphors to simplify learning. By leveraging concepts like Big Bang, orbits, satellites, gravitational centers, and gravitational force, Orbit tries to make it easier to grasp abstract ideas, allowing users to have an idea of Orbit before starting to use it.

### Why Orbit?

Because creating radial UIs generally involves resorting to JS or other languages to calculate angles, radius, distances, etc. **Orbit** helps and saves you a lot of time by allowing you to build these UIs with just CSS.

### What is a radial UI?

Radial UI refers to a design paradigm where elements are organized and laid out in a circular or radial pattern, rather than the traditional grid-based or linear layouts. This approach can create visually appealing and intuitive interfaces, especially for applications that involve:

- Circular data visualization (e.g., pie charts, multi-level pie charts, gauges, watch faces)
- Navigation menus or controls (e.g., radial or pie menus, circular scrolling)
- Dashboards (e.g., car dashboards, infotainment, smart-home dashboards)
- Landing pages (e.g., this Orbit landing page)


**Characteristics of Radial UI:**

- Circular layout: Elements are arranged in a circular or curved pattern.
- Center-focused: The center of the circle often serves as a focal point.
- Symmetry: Radial UIs often exhibit symmetry, creating a sense of balance.
- Angular relationships: Elements are positioned at specific angles relative to each other.

**Benefits of Radial UI:**

- Aesthetics: Radial designs can be visually stunning and engaging.
- Intuitive navigation: Circular layouts can simplify navigation and reduce cognitive load.
- Space efficiency: Radial UIs can make efficient use of screen real estate.
